<h2>Why I joined Code Nation</h2>
<p>I need to get a full time job in order to buy a house before I am priced out of the rental market in four years time. So I needed a skill that was in demand and could guarantee me a job. I started searching for free courses in Manchester and found a couple of coding ones. I researched coding and discovered that my skillset was very suited to the industry! I really enjoy problem solving, I am very logical and love learning!</p>
    
<h2>Goals</h2>
<h3>1. Buy a house</h3>
<p>Finish coding course and gain employment</p>

<h3>2. Get good enough in my band to start playing gigs</h2>
<p>Weekly band practise!</p>

<h3>3. Start working remotely so I can travel 6 months out of the year (when it goes cold and dark in the UK!)</h3>
<p>Work full time for a couple years to get experience and then find a remote job.</p>
