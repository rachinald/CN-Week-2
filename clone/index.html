            <p align="left">I am so grateful to be supporting Creative Yogis to <b>cultivate a creatively spiritual life</b> for themselves through a combination of <b>Movement & Mindset practices</b> so that their creations are an honest expression of who they are. 
                <br><br> 
                After my dad passed away in July 2014 my life flipped upside down. I decided that it was time to start living freely and make the most out of each and every day. 
                It didn't happen over night.
                I struggled through severe anxiety and negative thoughts cycles galore. 
                <br><br> 
                Then I found Yoga. (Cue the Angelic birdsong)
                <br><br> 
                Since then,  I have completed 650hrs of teacher training, accumulated 1500+ hours of  teaching experience, and spent 2 years living on a beach in India training students to become Yoga Teachers. 
                <br><br> 
                Now, my business allows me to live a life of meaning & purpose and constantly experience new things. 
                <br><br>  
                I know you have a <b>passion for personal growth and feeling accomplished. </b>
                <br><br> 
                With my support you can <b>cultivate a growth mindset</b> which will give you the <b>mental freedom</b>to develop your creative practice and help and inspire others. This means that you can create your desired income from creations that are an honest expression of who you are. 
                <br><br> 
                I can show you the door...but it's up to you to walk through it. I know you can do it...do you? </p>

                            <div class ="review"> Ciara is an awesome, inspiring and energetic teacher! Experienced her classes at my yoga teacher training in India and definitely, she loves movement and is great at passing on the enthusiasm through her classes, always managing to challenge you with fun poses and transitions. Her drama workshop/exercises add-ons are also worth mentioning and highly recommended! Hoping I get a chance to join Ciara's class again.</div>

I experienced Ciara as very open, heart warming, welcoming and at the same time highly professional. Her way of teaching the practice of yoga, theory and philosophy with her massive knowledge made it very easy for me to become a teacher myself.</div>

                            <div class ="review review3"> Ciara is a natural teacher and it’s obvious from the get-go how passionate she is about Yoga - both the practice and philosophy. On my YTT, there were so many elements to learn in such a short space of time, some of which I had difficulty with - particularly Sanskrit and Anatomy. However, Ciara has such a wonderful approach to teaching and her methods felt accessible for everyone - her analogies and visual references made even the most difficult things feel much easier to remember. She has such an in-depth knowledge of yoga, along with a strong personal practice - inspiring everyone she teaches. She also has a great sense of humour - she brought so much joy and laughter to her classes! I feel so lucky to have been taught by her.</div>
